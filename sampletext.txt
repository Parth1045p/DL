It was the best of times,

We are about to study the idea of a computational process.
Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.
As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data.
The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules
called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect,
we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
This tutorial will walk you through the key ideas of deep learning programming using Pytorch. Many of the concepts (such as the computation graph abstraction and autograd are not unique to Pytorch and are relevant to any deep learning tool kit out there.
